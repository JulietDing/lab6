##     Typography

- I picked h2 and h3's fonts to 'Oswald.'

- I changed p font to 'Lato.'

- I picked these fonts because they look more artistic and modern than the original page, which goes with the theme of the website more. Also, these two fonts go well with each other (according to google fonts' recomendations.

  ##Readability

- I added line-height for p so the content's not too packed together.

- I added letter-spacing for h2 and h3 because font 'Oswald' makes characters too close to each other.

  ## CRAP

  - I added a line in between each topic so the topics are more clearly separated
  - I added [ ] around h3 so it's easier to distinguish between main topic (h2) and sub-topics (h3).
